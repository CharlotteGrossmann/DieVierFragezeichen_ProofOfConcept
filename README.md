# Die Vier ????: Proof of Concept
Made with Kinect 360 and Unity3D </br>
Shows that we can track a person, recognize gestures and attach an object to a specific point on the users body</br>
</br>
Most work was done in these two [Scripts](https://github.com/CharlotteGrossmann/DieVierFragezeichen_ProofOfConcept/tree/master/kinect/Assets/GesturesDemo/Scripts) inside the "kinect" folder which contains the Unity project.</br>
The other folders contain the [Kinect with MS-SDK](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/kinect-with-ms-sdk-7747). The SDK contans a few example scenes which we mashed together to create this proof of concepts.
