# Die Vier ????: Proof of Concept
Made with Kinect 360 and Unity3D </br>
Shows that we can track a person, recognize gestures and attach an object to a specific point on the users body</br>
</br>
Most work was done in these two [Scripts](https://github.com/CharlotteGrossmann/DieVierFragezeichen_ProofOfConcept/tree/master/kinect/Assets/GesturesDemo/Scripts) inside the "kinect" folder which contains the Unity project.
Other folders are a SDK for Kinect to work with Unity with a few examples</br>
