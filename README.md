# Die Vier ????: Proof of Concept
Our proof of concept shows that we can track a person, recognize gestures and attach an object to a specific point on the users body.</br>
It's been made with Kinect 360 and Unity3D </br>
</br>
Most work was done in these two [scripts](https://github.com/CharlotteGrossmann/DieVierFragezeichen_ProofOfConcept/tree/master/kinect/Assets/GesturesDemo/Scripts) or Unity itself.</br>
The other folders contain the [Kinect with MS-SDK](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/kinect-with-ms-sdk-7747). It contans a few example scenes which we mashed together to create this poc.
